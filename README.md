# CurrencyCoverter
This python app retrieves conversion data from an API that updates daily. For more info on the API, follow this link to its website: http://www.floatrates.com

By using elements from the tkinter library, a UI is created to accept inputs and display results.
To convert two currencies, an object is made to store and format its info.
